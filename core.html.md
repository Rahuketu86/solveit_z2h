How to setup a github token in solveit

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

To set up a GitHub token in solveit, you’ll need to store it as an
environment variable. Here’s how:

You can set it in your code using:

``` python
import os
os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN'] = 'your_token_here'
```

However, for security reasons, you probably don’t want to hardcode your
token directly in the notebook.

Do you already have a GitHub personal access token created, or do you
need help creating one first?

How to change github remote url from http to ssh

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

To change your GitHub remote URL from HTTPS to SSH, you’ll use the
`git remote set-url` command.

First, you can check your current remote URL:

``` python
!git remote -v
```

Then, to change it to SSH, you’ll need to know your repository’s SSH URL
(which looks like `git@github.com:username/repo.git`).

Would you like me to show you the command to change it, or do you
already know your SSH URL and want to try it yourself first?

Show me entire command

##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->

Here’s the command:

``` python
!git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repo` with your
repository name.

If your remote is named something other than `origin`, replace that too.
